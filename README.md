The ambition is to release "Suburban" structure as a Distributed Open Source framework for mankind, no matter if it is Global , National, State or Tribe or even a future new society on other planets. 

The are are some principles and behaviours as inputs in the Suburban requirements and constraints

#### Requirements:
- Freedom of Speech - it must be absolute
- All minds matters - even the outermost extreme thoughts on any side or view is of value
- People love and hate - people must be allowed to both love and hate
- Focus wat matters - define levels of areas that are more important and prioritised

#### Constraints:
- Any Society can get value-add by re-using Suburban structure and contribute to evolve the Suburban structure
- Any sized society will have different ambitions, legal, apply laws of the focus areas
- Some areas are will emerge to be more important than others with different priority. 
- Ex. establish a Common ground for making sure the society is safe, secure and justiced.
- Execution and enforcement needs to be monitored, needs to be measured by its perfomance and outcome 
different accountability.
